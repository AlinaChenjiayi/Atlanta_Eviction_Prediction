# Atlanta Eviction Prediction
This project is for the 2023 Summer Data Science for Social Good practicum, sponsored by Emory's QTM department, Center for AI and Life, Enterprise Community Solutions, and Accenture. A prediction on eviction court filings in the Metro Atlanta area is conducted, and valuable insights into eviction trends is provided.

#### -- Project Status: [In Progress]

## Project Intro/Objective
Housing instability and eviction are prominent issues that contribute significantly to cycles of poverty, displacement, and socio-economic disparities in communities. The impact of these issues is extensively felt in cities like Atlanta, often leading to widespread consequences that affect community development, health, and overall quality of life.

The Atlanta Eviction Prediction Project is a strategic initiative aimed at addressing these challenges head-on by leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning. We believe that by harnessing the power of data, we can proactively identify potential housing crises, helping communities, policymakers, and social service organizations be better prepared to intervene and prevent evictions.

This project aims to create a model that predicts eviction rates in various neighborhoods throughout Atlanta, using a variety of indicators such as demographic data, economic factors, housing market trends, and other relevant predictors. By anticipating eviction risks and understanding their root causes, we can provide crucial insights and data-driven recommendations to stakeholders, informing them about the areas of greatest need.

This GitHub repository includes all code, data, and resources used in the development and implementation of this predictive model. We also did a final presentation, the slide is available here (Link)
